It seems there's an error related to parsing the JSON response. Let's modify the code to handle potential errors and improve the way we fetch JSON data:

```python
import requests

# List of Sonar projects keys
project_keys = ["jdjdj", "djdjnd"]  # Add more project keys as needed

# URL and token for the Sonar API
url = "https://sonar.abc.com/"
token = "djdnndnsn"

# Function to download data from a project key
def download_data(project_key):
    endpoint = f"{url}/api/hotspots/search?status=TO_REVIEW&projectKey={project_key}"
    try:
        response = requests.get(endpoint, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error downloading data for project {project_key}: {e}")
        return None

# Function to show progress in command prompt
def show_progress(project_key):
    print(f"Downloading data for project: {project_key}")

# Download data from all project keys sequentially
for key in project_keys:
    show_progress(key)
    data = download_data(key)
    if data:
        # Process the downloaded data as needed
        pass
    else:
        print(f"Failed to download data for project: {key}")
```

This updated code includes error handling for HTTP requests and printing error messages when data download fails for a project. This should help in troubleshooting and identifying any issues with fetching JSON data.
