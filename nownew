Got it. Here's the modified code where "@" and everything after it is excluded from the username:

```python
user = next((user for user in user_details if user["id"] == lead_id), None)
if user:
    username = user.get("username", "")
    email = username.split("@")[0]  # Exclude everything after '@' symbol
if target_end and target_end != "None" and datetime.strptime(target_end, "%Y-%m-%d").date() < today:
```

This code will split the username at the "@" symbol and take the first part (the part before "@") as the username. This effectively removes "@abc.com" from the username.
