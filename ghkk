To convert all JSON files in a folder to XLSX format properly, you can use a programming language like Python with libraries such as pandas and openpyxl. Here's a sample script to accomplish this task:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd

# Function to convert JSON to XLSX
def convert_json_to_xlsx(json_file, output_file):
    # Read JSON file into pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.read_json(json_file)
    
    # Write DataFrame to XLSX file
    df.to_excel(output_file, index=False)

# Folder containing JSON files
folder_path = 'path/to/json/files'

# Output folder for XLSX files
output_folder = 'output/path/'

# Create output folder if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
    os.makedirs(output_folder)

# Loop through each file in the folder
for file_name in os.listdir(folder_path):
    if file_name.endswith('.json'):
        # Construct full file paths
        json_file = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name)
        output_file = os.path.join(output_folder, os.path.splitext(file_name)[0] + '.xlsx')
        
        # Convert JSON to XLSX
        convert_json_to_xlsx(json_file, output_file)

print("Conversion completed successfully.")
```

Replace `'path/to/json/files'` with the path to the folder containing your JSON files, and `'output/path/'` with the desired path for the output XLSX files. Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the pandas and openpyxl libraries (`pip install pandas openpyxl`). Then, run this script, and it will convert all JSON files in the specified folder to XLSX format properly.
