Certainly! You can modify the code to extract the usernames and remove the "@" symbol and everything after it before counting the words. Here's the modified code:

```python
import requests

def fetch_usernames(url, headers, params):
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        usernames = [user["username"].split('@')[0] for user in response.json()["results"]]
        print(f"List of users: {usernames}")
        return usernames
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch usernames")
        return []

# Example usage:
url = "your_api_url"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_token"}
params = {"query": "your_query_params"}
usernames = fetch_usernames(url, headers, params)
```

This will split each username at the "@" symbol and take only the part before it, effectively removing the "@" symbol and everything after it.
