To send a POST request instead of a GET request, you can use various methods depending on your programming language or tool. Here's a basic example using Python with the requests library:

```python
import requests

url = "https://abc.sonar.def.com/api/issues/do_transition"
data = {
    "issue": "jsjsjjsjsjdjd",
    "transition": "confirm"
}

response = requests.post(url, data=data)

print(response.text)
```

Replace the `"jsjsjjsjsjdjd"` and `"confirm"` with your actual issue ID and transition value. This code will send a POST request to the specified URL with the provided data.
