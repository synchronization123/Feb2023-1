**Problem Statement:**

The current security analysis process within our organization involves manual review of functional specifications, design specifications, and code, leading to significant turnaround times and potential oversight of security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the absence of a centralized repository of known vulnerable code patterns further complicates the review process, hampering the efficiency and effectiveness of our security efforts.

To address these challenges, there is a critical need to develop a comprehensive utility that automates and expedites the security analysis process while incorporating our internally collected vulnerable code patterns. This utility should facilitate rapid analysis of functional and design specifications, automate code review tasks, and leverage our repository of known vulnerable code patterns to enhance the accuracy of vulnerability detection.

The utility should achieve the following objectives:

1. Automate the analysis of functional specifications, design specifications, and code to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
2. Streamline the code review process by automating repetitive tasks and providing actionable insights to security analysts, thereby improving the turnaround time of reviews.
3. Incorporate our internally collected repository of vulnerable code patterns to enhance the accuracy and completeness of vulnerability detection.
4. Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of security analysis efforts, reducing the likelihood of security breaches and strengthening the overall security posture of our systems.

By developing and implementing such a utility, our organization can significantly improve its security analysis capabilities, expedite the review process, and better protect our systems and data from potential cyber threats.
