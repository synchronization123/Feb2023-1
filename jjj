If the API requires authentication, you'll need to include an authentication key in your request headers. Here's how you can modify the Python code to include an authentication key:

```python
import requests

url = "https://abc.sonar.def.com/api/issues/do_transition"
data = {
    "issue": "jsjsjjsjsjdjd",
    "transition": "confirm"
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE"
}

response = requests.post(url, data=data, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

Replace `"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE"` with your actual authentication token. This code will send a POST request with the provided data and include the authentication token in the request headers.
